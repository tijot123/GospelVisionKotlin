We are certain that one could never have 'enough' of the Word of God for in it is the power of transformation and it is our desire to see every believer powerfully impacted by the Word. To this end, we telecast systematic preaching of local and foreign preachers, Biblical answers for healthy living, secrets to financial freedom, praise and worship, live talk-shows, kids and teens programmes, women's hour etc. among others, with a view to making the Gospel accessible to people from all walks of life. As such, we are committed to 'preach the Word of God and to equip and build up the saints'."
